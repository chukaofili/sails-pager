# Usage

## paginate(options)

This function helps you paginate any model passed to the paginate function.

* Create `YourController.js` file. Insert into following code.
```javascript
var pager = require('sails-pager');

module.exports = {
    list: function(req, res) {
        var perPage = req.query.per_page;
        var currentPage = req.query.page;
        var conditions = {active: true};

        //Using Promises
        pager.paginate(SailsModelHere, conditions, currentPage, perPage, [{name: 'AssociatedModel', query: {isDeleted: false}}], 'createdAt DESC').then(function(records){
            console.log(records);
        }).catch(function(err) {
            console.log(err);
        });

        //Using a Callback
        pager.paginate(SailsModelHere, conditions, currentPage, perPage, [{name: 'AssociatedModel', query: {isDeleted: false}}], 'createdAt DESC', function(err, records){
            if(err){
                console.log(err);
            }
            console.log(records);
        });
  },
}
```

The `pager.paginate()` function takes the following options:

1. *model* (required): Pass the sails model you want to query.
2. *conditions* (required | object, pass *{}* if you have no conditions): This are the conditions for the query pass to the model in 1 above.
3. *currentPage* (required | integer): This is the current page value for the dataset to return.
4. *perPage* (required | integer): The number of results to return per page, you can pass false to ignore.
5. *populateData* (required | array/collection): This is the associated sails model to populate. Multiple models can be populated eg: If main model=User then you can use ['pets', 'images'] or ['pets'] to populate only the User's associated pets. You can also pass populate queries, but you'll have to use a slightly different syntax by pass an object with the name & query properties. eg model=User, ['pets', {name: 'images', query: {isDeleted: false}}], this will populate the User's pets & all images that have not been deleted. You can pass false to ignore.
6. *sort* (required | string): Pass the same sailsjs sort syntax. You can pass false to ignore.

Options order: `pager.paginate(model, conditions, currentPage, perPage, populateData, sort);`

Please note that the pagination module will return your records in a specific format.


## paginatePupulate(options)

This function helps you paginate any populated data stripping the main model data eg: If a User has many pets and you would like to retrieve a paginated set of the users pets, You'll pass the User as the main model and pass the pets as the populateData, please note this does not support queries yet like the main paginate() function.

The `pager.paginatePopulate()` function takes the same options as the `paginate()` with the exception of the populateData: You can eaither pass a string to the `pager.paginatePopulate()` or an object not an array cos you can only paginate one set of pupolated data at once.

1. *populateData* (required | string)
2. *populateData* (required | object) e.g 
```
//example object of 'populateData'
{name: 'AssociatedModel', query: {isDeleted: false}, select:['attribute1','attributed2', '...']}
```

## Returned Records

Example returned records object;
```
{
    "message": "Data retrieved successfully",
    "data": [{data goes here}],
    "meta": {
        "page": 1,
        "perPage": 20,
        "previousPage": false,
        "nextPage": 2,
        "pageCount": 4,
        "total": 79
    }
}
```

## Nice to have
- populate inside a populate (Nested Populate).
